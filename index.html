                <h3>Where & when was this culture practiced?</h3>
                <p>The culture of the samurai was practiced in feudal Japan. Samurai were found all across Japan.
                    <br><br>
                    Samurai culture first started in the late 12th century during the Kamakura period (1192-1333). This unique culture evolved over time throughout the various time periods in Japan.
                    <br><br>
                    During the Edo period (1603-1867), samurais were locked into their social standing and forced to work for the government or take up a trade because of the military dictatorship in order to freeze the social order and stabilize society. This was a 250 year period. Many Samurai lived on the allownce given by the government, the amount of which slowly decreased over time despite their social standing; many were in poverty by the end of the Edo period.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1871, samurai warriors lost their power along with the abolishment of feudalism in Japan.

                <h3>The role of the Samurai</h3>
                <p>
                    The samurai were first known as provincial warriors who were employed by wealthy landlords but they later rose in power to become members of a powerful military caste.
                    <br><br>
                    Early samurai worked for landlords becuase they had a specilized skillset and were talented fighters. They protected the land from enemies of all kinds including hostile tribes or bandits.
                    <br><br>
                    Later, during the Kamakura period (1192-1467), the samurai fought for political warlords and took over the government establishing shogun rule.

                <h3>Bushido Code</h3>
                <p>
                    The Bushido code was a code of conduct that set the ethical standards for all samurai warriors. 
                    <br><br>
                    “Bushido” is made of the words “bushi”, or “warrior”, and “do” meaning “way”. The translation of “Bushido” is “Way of the Warrior”. 
                    <br><br>
                    Although the name “Bushido” was not used until the 1700s, the idea of the code was developed as early as the 12th century. This code upheld ideas such as bravery, honor, and personal loyalty. <span id="seppuku">In fact, samurai warriors would sometimes perform a specific form of suicide (“seppuku”) to avoid dishonor or defeat in battle.</span>

                <h3>Weapons and Armor of the Samurai</h3>
                <p>
                    The samurai’s status was largely expressed though the armor and weapons they carried.
                    <br><br>
                    The samurai's armor was often made by skilled artisans often from flexible iron scales so they were foldable, easy to repair, and beautiful. Their armor could be used for public display as well as fighting. It was also a symbol of the samurai’s style. Some samurai wore helmets decorated with deer antlers so that they could be seen by others.
                    <br><br>
                    The main weapons used by samurai were swords, spears, and bows. 
                    <br><br>
                    Swords were the most iconic weapon of the samurai showing status.
                    Of course, there are different types of swords. These include katanas, a short sword known as a wakizashi, and a knife called a tanto.

                <h3>Why is it important to learn about this culture?</h3>
                <p>
                    Learning about different cultures, in general, helps us understand differences from our own culture and better accept different beliefs and practices. 
                    <br><br>
                    Learning about samurai culture specifically shows differences in Japan’s military. This also provides some background on more recent topics, for example, Japan’s merciless fighting during world war 2.
